# 《寂静之声》与《加州旅馆》之诗经版 

Zeme，才女也！
之前有一个scarborough fair的诗经版，在网上流传甚广。作为古文爱好者兼语文课代表的Zeme，也尝试把The Eagel的《加州旅馆》以及毕业生插曲《寂静之声》这两首经典的歌曲，用诗经体翻译出来，不知道这样的创作是否会引起共鸣？
Zeme说：“身边喜欢古文的童鞋似乎不多，觉得蛮可惜的。古文给我予简洁与优雅，真希望能有越来越多的人喜欢。=）”
1.Sound Of Silence 
1968年奥斯卡特级经典电影《毕业生》的主题歌《寂静之声》，聊以古文译之：
（《寂静之声》旋律飘缓低迷，歌词充满了一种幻觉般的意境。细细听来，仿佛在诉说着年轻无助的一种宣泄。眼前似乎看到一个懵懂无知的女孩，独自一人行走在铺着鹅卵石的狭窄、清冷的小巷里，喧嚣的人群在她身后渐渐远去，前面是没有尽头的黑夜……）
Hello darkness, my old friend,
寂静吾友，君可安然。
I’ve come to talk with you again,
又会君面，默语而谈。
Because a vision softly creeping, Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
浮光掠影，清梦彷徨。
And the vision that was planted in my brain ，Still remains
幽幽往昔，慰我心房。
Within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone
寂静之声，孤独过往。
Narrow streets of cobblestone, ‘Neath the halo of a street lamp,
迢迢陋巷，回声辗转。
I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
薄襟何耐，子夜灯凉。
That split the night，And touched the sound of silence.
忧伤流布，寂寞声残。
And in the naked light I saw，Ten thousand people, maybe more.
忽而望之，灯下熙攘。
People talking without speaking, People hearing without listening,
无声而言，无事而忙。
People writing songs that voices never share ，And no one dare Disturb the sound of silence.
妙音难享，曲成即藏。
“Fools” said I, “You do not know Silence like a cancer grows.
愚者何知，寂静如伤。
hear my words that I might teach you, Take my arms that I might reach you.”
且相携手，听我衷肠。
But my words like silent raindrops fell, And echoed In the wells of silence
寂静雨珠，连落难断。
And the people bowed and prayed ，To the neon god they made.
造神祈祷，正经虔然。
And the sign flashed out its warning, In the words that it was forming.
警语宣诫，且莫失忘。
And the sign said, “The words of the prophets
are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls.”
万千心语，谁知其详？
And whisper’d in the sounds of silence.
In the sounds of silence
In the sounds of silence
唯尔寂静，轻声永传。
就是这种感觉，让我们再来听听由班得瑞演绎的旋律
2.Hotel California
（这首歌可以说是Eagles在最佳状态、最佳组合之下完成的一首旷世之作，是充满诡异、动人旋律的钻石级金曲，单看歌词，寥寥数笔，便几乎把上世纪70年代 所有的忧伤与迷惘卷携殆尽。这首 《加州旅馆》 在1977年连续8周获得排行榜冠军的位置，歌曲特殊之处在于Don Felder与Joe Walsh弹奏的双吉他效果。在《滚石》评出的最伟大的100首英文歌曲中名列第十一。）
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
子夜荒原,风啸吾鬓.
Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
燥风鼓涌,气蒸腾迷.
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
引首彼方,灯火豆荧.
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
昏弱已极,抬眼欲迷.
I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway;
渴求投栖,忽见娉婷.
I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself, “This could be Heaven or this could be Hell”
恍惚存疑,未知何地?
Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
烛炬微燃,示吾前行.
There were voices down the corridor, I thought I heard them say…
骤闻歌泣,侧耳倾听.
“Welcome to the Hotel California
幸哉行者,至此仙境.
Such a lovely place, Such a lovely face
福地洞天,妙颜清丽.
Plenty of rooms at the Hotel California
客舍俨然,轩室无尽.
Any time of year, you can find it here ”
何时来此,永可欢愉.
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
伊人心深,曲丝琉璃.
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends
宝鞍良驹,少年如云.
How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
庭院蹁跹,蜜汗甜雨.
Some dance to remember, some dance to forget
或舞为忘,或舞为忆.
So I called up the Captain, “Please bring me my wine” He said, ‘We haven’t had that spirit here since 1969′
唤仆取酒,答已久磬.
And still those voices are calling from far away, Wake you up in the middle of the night
远歌遥吟,震耳惊心.
Just to hear them say…
幽幽一曲,行者何幸!
“Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place，Such a lovely face
福地洞天,妙颜清丽.
They livin’ it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise, bring your alibis”
沉醉纵乐, 何顾德行.
Mirrors on the ceiling, The pink champagne on ice
粉冰沉醴,玉镜莹莹.
And she said ‘We are all just prisoners here, of our own device’
吾辈为囚,臣服诸欲.
And in the master’s chambers, They gathered for the feast
堂室辉煌,开宴相聚.
They stab it with their steely knives, But they just can’t kill the beast
剑影刀光,狂舞无益.
Last thing I remember, I was running for the door I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
惊惶疾奔,逃寻归径.
Relax,’ said the night-man,
侍者低语,佳客莫惊,
” We are programmed to receive.
吾等相守,永来伺宾.
You can checkout any time you like,
君既来此,莫思相离.
but you can never leave!”
告别无期,在此心狱!

斯卡布罗集市

 Translated by Lou Ming
问尔所之，是否如适 Are you going to Scarborough Fair
 蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme
 彼方淑女，凭君寄辞 Remember me to one who lives there
 伊人曾在，与我相知 She once was a true love of mine
嘱彼佳人，备我衣缁 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
 蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme
 勿用针剪，无隙无疵 Without no seams nor needle work
 伊人何在，慰我相思 Then she will be a true love of mine
伴唱：
彼山之阴，深林荒址 On the side of hill in the deep forest green
 冬寻毡毯，老雀燕子 Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown
 雪覆四野，高山迟滞 Blankets and bed clothers the child of maintain
 眠而不觉，寒笳清嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
嘱彼佳人，营我家室 Tell her to find me an acre of land
 蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme
 良田所修，大海之坻 Between the salt water and the sea strand
 伊人应在，任我相视 Then she will be a true love of mine
伴唱：
彼山之阴，叶疏苔蚀 On the side of hill a sprinkling of leaves
 涤彼孤冢，珠泪渐渍 Washes the grave with slivery tears
 昔我长剑，日日拂拭 A soldier cleans and polishes a gun
 寂而不觉，寒笳长嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
嘱彼佳人，收我秋实 Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
 蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsely sage rosemary and thyme
 敛之集之，勿弃勿失 And gather it all in a bunch of heather
 伊人犹在，唯我相誓 Then she will be a ture love of mine
伴唱：
烽火印啸，浴血之师 War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions
 将帅有令，勤王之事 Generals order their soldiers to kill and to fight for a cause
 争斗缘何，久忘其旨 They have long ago forgoten
 痴而不觉，寒笳悲嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
